## About me

JM is a Lead - Software Test Engineer with hands-on experience in Software Development/Test Life Cycle with role of executing and conducting different types of testing, such as Unit, API, load, integration, database, unit, manual functional and automation.

I've been exposed in V-Model variant of Waterfall Methodology in 3 years project in Japanese car manufacturing client - as embedded unit tester (code coverage testing), and then currently deployed in other different projects with Agile Scrum Methodology implementations and practices.
